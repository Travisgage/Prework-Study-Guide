# Prework-Study-Guide
Prework study guide for Fullstack coding bootcamp April 2024. The primary motivation for this project is to consolidate learned material from the prework modules in one easily accessible place. This project solves the problem of clearly summarizing key information from the prework to be referenced at a later date. Throughout the project, I learned basic concepts for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
